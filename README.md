# Introduction

LACChain Mailbox enables an email-like messaging for third-party issued Verifiable Credentials (VC). Using a secure and controlled server to store encrypted VCs, LACChain Mailbox delivers a simple, secure, messaging experience for sending and receiving Verifiable Credentials with total privacy.

LACChain Mailbox also provides an API solution to use the DID resolution functionality, sending and receiving encrypted VC from any application.


# 1. Creating a DID

The DID method used in LACChain Mailbox is "ethr", this method stores the public keys and attributes of the DID in a Smart Contract which is called a DIDRegistry. 
The following url describes the structure and steps to generate a new DID.

https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry

The LACChain DID Registry has been deployed in the following addresses.

| Network                                  | Address                                                |
| -----------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pro TestNet (id: 648529)                 |      0x488C83c4D1dDCF8f3696273eCcf0Ff4Cf54Bf277        |
| MultiLedgers (id: 648539)                |      0xd6A7c915066E17ba18024c799258C8A286fFBc00        |
| David19 (id: 648530)                     |      Pending to deploy...                              |

# 2. Adding Public Key Encryption
 
In order to send and receive Verifiable Credentials using LACChain Mailbox, it is required to encrypt the VC before sending it.
The public key associated for encryption of the VC must be added to the DID through the 
`` setAttribute(address identity, bytes32 name, bytes value, uint validity) `` function of the DIDRegistry Smart Contract.

Example: 

```
DIDRegistry.setAttribute( 'did/pub/X25519/enc/base64', encryptionPublicKeyBase64 );
```  
The proposed encryption algorithm is [NACL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/), an asymmetric key algorithm.

# 3. Resolving a DID

In order to reconstruct and resolve a DID use the following URL:

http://34.68.56.94:8080/did/{did}

Example: 

GET  http://34.68.56.94:8080/did/did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891

Response:
````
{
   "@context":"https://w3id.org/did/v1",
   "id":"did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891",
   "publicKey":[
      {
         "id":"did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891#owner",

         "ethereumAddress":"0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891"
      },
      {

      }
   ]
}

Currently, the LACChain Mailbox can resolve the following methods, networks and subnets:

| Method                         |        Network              | Subnetwork |
| -------------------------------| ----------------------------|------------|

In the future we are going to support more DID methods and their corresponding networks.
 
# 4. Authentication
 The authentication process consists in requesting a string challenge in order to sign further petitions:

### Request a challenge.
 In this step, the server will send a random string that the client must use 
 to sign with their DID and send it in headers section.
 
 URL Path: /auth/{did}
 
 HTTP Method: GET
 
 Response:
 ```
{
    "challenge": "zW7dPhe2TiSTi25i"
}
 ```

# 5. Sending a VC
 Before sending a new VC, it is required to encrypt it with the private key generated for that purpose with the DID method. The encrypted VC must be encoded into an array of bytes. 
To send a new VC, it is required to sign the keccak-256 hash challenge and attach it in the signature header.

URL Path: /vc

HTTP Method: POST

Request Headers:
 ```
signature: sign(keccak256(challenge))
 ```

Request Body:
 ```
{
    "from": "did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891"
    "to": "did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821892",
    "vc": {
        "type": "Buffer", // always Buffer
        "value": [byte]
    }

}
 ```

Response Body:
 ```
{
    result: true // or false 
    error:  in  case of result=false
}
 ```

# 6. Gathering Verifiable Credentials

 To get the list of VC associated with a given DID, it is required to sign the keccak-256 hash challenge and attach it in the signature header.
 
URL Path: /vc/{did}


HTTP Method: GET

Request Headers:
 ```
signature: sign(keccak256(challenge))
 ```

Response Body:
 ```
[
	{
		"type": "Buffer",
		"data": [encrypted buffer data bytes]
	}
]
 ```

# 7. Clear Mailbox

 To remove all VC associated with a given DID, it is required to sign the keccak-256 hash challenge and attach it in the signature header.
 
URL Path: /vc/{did}


HTTP Method: DELETE

Request Headers:
 ```
signature: sign(keccak256(challenge))
 ```

Response Body:
 ```
true // If all the VCs were deleted
 ```

# 8. Using DID DNS

To resolve the status of a DID use the following URL:

http://34.68.56.94:8080/dns/{did}

Example: 

GET  http://34.68.56.94:8080/dns/did:ethr:lacchain:0x01cd0acdfb36140d0dc6a4d917693ae641821891

Response Body:
````
{
    "entity": "BID Lab",
    "expires": 5627255824,
    "status": true
}
````
